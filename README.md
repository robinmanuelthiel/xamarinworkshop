# Xamarin Workshop 📱
Welcome, it is good to see you here being interested in learning how to write native mobile applications for iOS, Android and Windows in C#. Take some time to read the prerequisites, prepare your machine and start with the first lesson, when you are ready.

## Prerequisites
Please read the [Minimum System Requirements](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/requirements/) to check if your system is ready. If you need help in preparing your development environment check the [Setting up module](/02%20Setting%20up).

> **Hint:** Installation and Setup of your Xamarin development environment can be a little bit tricky as so many different components have to intertwine. This list just describes what you need. You don't have to install it now, as there is an own  [Setting up module](/02%20Setting%20up).

**Mandatory**
- Development machine (Windows 10, OS X El Capitan or macOS Sierra)
- IDE ([Visual Studio for Windows](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) or [Xamarin Studio for Mac](https://www.xamarin.com/download))
- [Microsoft Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) (free trial)
- Internet connection

**Recommended**
- Any Android emulator
- A Mac machine anywhere in your network as iOS Build Host

## Contribution
Creating workshops all on my own is now fun especially as I am far from being a perfect developer or tutor. So this workshop is all about teamwork! All information that I try to provide here are state of the art as I write this workshop but technology change over time. Although I try to keep this workshop up-to-date, there always might be something outdated. In addition, this workshop is based on my personal knowledge, which means that it is definitely not perfect.

If you know something better, have a good idea, want to correct something or know a better teaching style please feel free to create a pull request. This workshop is getting better with every single contribution!

Thank you ❤️
